1、Round-Optimal and Communication-Efficient Multiparty Computation
--Michele Ciampi and Rafail Ostrovsky and Hendrik Waldner and Vassilis Zikas
https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1437.pdf

  介绍：We provide two round-preserving black-box compiler. By using our first compiler with a round-optimal MPC, we derive the first round-optimal and
circuit-scalable maliciously secure MPC in the plain model.
  By using this second compiler with a round-optimal MPC, we derive the first round-optimal and circuit-independent maliciously secure MPC in the plain model.
  Our compilers assume the existence of four-round maliciously secure oblivious transfer which can be obtained from standard cryptographic assumptions.  

2、Towards Multiparty Computation Withstanding Coercion of All Parties
--Ran Canetti and Oxana Poburinnaya
https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1434.pdf

  介绍：We consider, for the first time, the setting where all parties are coerced（被强制）, and the coercer expects to see the entire history of the computation.
  model:common reference string which is generated once and for all by an uncorruptable trusted party
  • A general multi-party function evaluation protocol, for any number of parties, that withstands coercion of all parties, as long as all parties use the prescribed “faking algorithm” upon coercion. 
  • A general two-party function evaluation protocol that withstands even the case where some of the coerced parties do follow the prescribed faking algorithm. 
  when instantiated using the fully deniable encryption of Canetti, Park, and Poburinnaya [Crypto’20], it takes 3 rounds of communication.

3、Constant-Overhead Unconditionally Secure Multiparty Computation over Binary Fields
--Antigoni Polychroniadou and Yifan Song
https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1412.pdf

  介绍：there are no n-party protocols with constant overhead admitting communication complexity of O(n) bits per gate.
  In this work, we construct the first unconditional MPC protocol secure against a malicious adversary in the honest majority setting evaluating just a single boolean circuit with amortized communication complexity of O(n) bits per gate.
